===========

Simple XML to JavaScript object converter. It supports bi-directional conversion.
Uses [sax-js](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js/) and
[xmlbuilder-js](https://github.com/oozcitak/xmlbuilder-js/).

Note: If you're looking for a full DOM parser, you probably want
[JSDom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).
