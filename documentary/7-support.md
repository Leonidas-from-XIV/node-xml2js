Getting support
===============

Please, if you have a problem with the library, first make sure you read this
README. If you read this far, thanks, you're good. Then, please make sure your
problem really is with `xml2js`. It is? Okay, then I'll look at it. Send me a
mail and we can talk. Please don't open issues, as I don't think that is the
proper forum for support problems. Some problems might as well really be bugs
in `xml2js`, if so I'll let you know to open an issue instead :)

But if you know you really found a bug, feel free to open an issue instead.
