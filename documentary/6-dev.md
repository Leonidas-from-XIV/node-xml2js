The development requirements are handled by npm, you just need to install them.
We also have a number of unit tests, they can be run using `npm test` directly
from the project root. This runs zap to discover all the tests and execute
them.

If you like to contribute, keep in mind that `xml2js` is written in
CoffeeScript, so don't develop on the JavaScript files that are checked into
the repository for convenience reasons. Also, please write some unit test to
check your behaviour and if it is some user-facing thing, add some
documentation to this README, so people will know it exists. Thanks in advance!
