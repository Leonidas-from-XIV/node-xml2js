# How to contribute

We're always happy about useful new pull requests. Keep in mind that the better
your pull request is, the easier it can be added to `xml2js`. As such please
make sure your patch is ok:

 * Make sure that the unit tests still all pass. Failing unit tests mean that
   someone *will* run into a bug, if we accept your pull request.
 * Please, add a unit test with your pull request, to show what was broken and
   is now fixed or what was impossible and now works due to your new code.
 * If you add a new feature, please add some documentation that it exists.

If you like, you can add yourself in the `package.json` as contributor if you
deem your contribution significant enough. Otherwise, we will decide and maybe
add you.
